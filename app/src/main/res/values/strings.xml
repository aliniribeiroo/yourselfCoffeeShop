    <string name="infos">Here at Yourself Coffee More, we believe this to be true: that if passion, hard work and excellence go into an endeavor, the outcome will be a quality experience, and therefore rewarding.
In 1990, during an adventure through the Alaskan wilderness, our founders journeyed to the top of Sable Mountain. After a strenuous climb, they reached the summit and were rewarded with a sensational view: the boundless mountains, a clear blue sky, and a herd of caribou thundering through the valley. That was truly the "aha" moment.
The breathtaking panoramic view became the entrepreneurial vision for Yourself Coffee  More - a company that believes excellence is a product of hard work, and that life is too short for anything else. This vision serves as a guide as we strive to create a special experience for you here at Yourself Coffee  More.
Now, we invite you as our guest along this path. Enjoy a moment, or several, filled with the highest-quality coffee and our unparalleled service. </string>
